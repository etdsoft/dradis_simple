# DradisSimple

This is a very simple proof-of-concept of a plugin-as-a-gem plugin for the [Dradis Framework](http://github.com/dradis/dradisframework).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's `Gemfile`:

    gem 'dradis_simple'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install dradis_simple

## Usage

Truth is, there is not much to do. Load the plugin in your `Gemfile` and you will be able to see it inside the Upload Manager.
